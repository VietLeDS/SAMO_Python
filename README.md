# SAMO_Python
These are the Python scripts that I used for my real work as a Business Intelligence in the SAMO Group.
In case the company is lack of Data Engineer and other Data experts, I have to build my data system 100% by myself.
In this system, I used Python to clean, integrate and manipulate data in order to import to the PowerBI for storage and analysis.
